# Project Overview

## Project Name:

ScheduLion

## Project Description:

- LMU's athletic director, Craig Pintens, has approached us with a fascinating data problem: devising a system that can construct / assist them in constructing the best schedule of opponent teams for the basketball season as a function of the team's RPI (rating percentage index), special features constructed by the coaching team, and raw data provided by services like KenPom.

- The problem: the formula used to compute RPI is not public knowledge, schedules must take into account opponents with a good ratio of RPI and likelihood of defeat, and a number of other features that will constitute the model like coaching styles and what constitutes a good "matchup."

- The solution: ScheduLion, which will be used by the LMU Athletics Department to construct next year's schedule, to score opponents based on the above with the goal of constructing a schedule with the highest expected RPI increase for LMU.

- This is a quintessential CS project: optimization meets probability meets constraint satisfaction (algorithms and AI fans unite)!

## Project Justification:

- Automate a tedious task previously done by-hand and prone to human-error

- Provide LMU’s basketball department with the resources to produce a schedule conducive to wins

- Schedule games that ensure a strong strength of schedule by calculating the complex NET score

- A passion for basketball and a passion for LMU

- Go Lions!

## Product, Technical, and Design Documentation:

- Architecture/Tech Stack Diagram
  ![](../images/tech_stack_diagram.png)

- Previous experience using many of the technologies we used in our previous classes

- Technologies help with rapid development and implementation, as well as, allowing for future scalability.

- We are using emerging industry standard frameworks and libraries that will continue to develop allowing for room for future growth.

## Product Scope:

- Form a model that produces the NET value, given the variables, past schedules, and raw data

- Produce a model that assigns a score to each opponent and computes strength of schedule for a given schedule

- A desktop application and schedule building platform to allow the LMU Athletics Department to login and create schedules conducive to wins
